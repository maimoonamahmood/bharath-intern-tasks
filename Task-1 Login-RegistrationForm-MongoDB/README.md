# Login Registration Form
I have created a Login and Registration Form with NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB. This is a Basic Version of the Login and Signup Form which I have created using a bit of help from a few Youtube videos.






### Sign up to create an account without an account it would show invalid credentials.

# Once, you have installed the dependancies for the project using NodeJS, Open your Mongo DataBase using the MongoDB Compass GUI Application click on "Create a Database" and enter the following details:

```
Database Name: LoginSignup

Collection Name: logincollections
```

# Once, you have created the Database to store all the user data, you can run the following command in the terminal of the project directory to start the ExpressJS server using nodemon:

```
nodemon src/index.js
```

### The database gets updated every time user enters with different accounts/credentials
